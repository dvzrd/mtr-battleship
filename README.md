## What it is

A simple battleship game that uses an API

### The API endpoints

> A more thorough breakdown coming soon.

* Create a game
* Destroy a game
* Accepts coordinates for the player’s next move.
* Returns the coordinates for the CPU’s next move.

### The game works like this

* A battleship occupies one block.
* The starting board will be 5x5.
* The player starts a game and places 10 ships on the board.
* The player submits their positions on the board via the API.
* The CPU places its ships on the board.
* The player is given the first move and submits coordinates to strike.
* If a ship is hit, it is destroyed.
* Allow the CPU to attack.
* Alternate moves between player and CPU.
* The first player to have all ships destroyed is the loser.

### Roadmap

* ~~Add in user sessions so the server can handle more than one game at a time.~~
* Add a leaderboard that keeps winner’s initials and ranks them according to the time it took them to win.
* ~~Players can post comments (chat) during a game.~~
* ~~Deploy the application.~~

## How to use

### Requirements

Make sure [Meteor is installed and up to date](https://www.meteor.com/install) or run:

```sh
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

### Run Locally

```sh
git clone git@github.com:amazingBastard/mtr-battleship.git
cd mtr-battleship
```

Run the following to get the bash file to work:  

```
chmod +x ./run.sh
```

Now you can start the app with the following command `./run.sh` and the app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>

### Deployment

Make sure you have Meteor Up (mup) installed.  

```sh
npm install -g mup
```

Configure your mup.json file for deployment in environments/production dir. This is an example file:  

```js
{
  // Server authentication info
  "servers": [
    {
      "host": "hostname",
      "username": "root",
      "password": "password",
      // or pem file (ssh based authentication)
      //"pem": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
      // Also, for non-standard ssh port use this
      //"sshOptions": { "port" : 49154 },
      // server specific environment variables
      "env": {}
    }
  ],

  // Install MongoDB on the server. Does not destroy the local MongoDB on future setups
  "setupMongo": true,

  // WARNING: Node.js is required! Only skip if you already have Node.js installed on server.
  "setupNode": true,

  // WARNING: nodeVersion defaults to 0.10.36 if omitted. Do not use v, just the version number.
  "nodeVersion": "0.10.36",

  // Install PhantomJS on the server
  "setupPhantom": true,

  // Show a progress bar during the upload of the bundle to the server.
  // Might cause an error in some rare cases if set to true, for instance in Shippable CI
  "enableUploadProgressBar": true,

  // Application name (no spaces).
  "appName": "meteor",

  // Location of app (local directory). This can reference '~' as the users home directory.
  // i.e., "app": "~/Meteor/my-app",
  // This is the same as the line below.
  "app": "/Users/arunoda/Meteor/my-app",

  // Configure environment
  // ROOT_URL must be set to https://YOURDOMAIN.com when using the spiderable package & force SSL
  // your NGINX proxy or Cloudflare. When using just Meteor on SSL without spiderable this is not necessary
  "env": {
    "PORT": 80,
    "ROOT_URL": "http://myapp.com",
    "MONGO_URL": "mongodb://arunoda:fd8dsjsfh7@hanso.mongohq.com:10023/MyApp",
    "MAIL_URL": "smtp://postmaster%40myapp.mailgun.org:adj87sjhd7s@smtp.mailgun.org:587/"
  },

  // Meteor Up checks if the app comes online just after the deployment.
  // Before mup checks that, it will wait for the number of seconds configured below.
  "deployCheckWaitTime": 15
}
```

From the environments/production dir, run ```mup setup``` to setup the server. Then, running ```mup deploy``` will deploy your app.
